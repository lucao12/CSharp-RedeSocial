# C# Tutorial â€“ Create a Zombie Survival Shooting Game in Visual Studio
Hello and welcome to this exciting new tutorial from MOO ICT. In this tutorial we will show you how to make a top down style zombie shooter survival game. The main object of this game is to shoot as many zombies as possible and survive. The player has a health bar which can deplete if the zombies touch you and you can shoot in all 4 directions and collect ammo when it runs out. Zombies will mindlessly follow you in the game and just make sure you keep them off you. 

We make this game fully inside of Visual Studio with Windows form components and C# programming language. This video tutorial will take through the whole process of how to set up the game, the character, bullet, timer and more. We go over some critical game development methods such as events, player actions, dynamically creating objects in windows form and removing them when we don't need them in the game. 

This is one of the longest tutorial I have done so far, I really hope you find this helpful in your journey and finally keep programming, keep making stuff. Moo Out.
